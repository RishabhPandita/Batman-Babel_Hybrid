BatmanAdv-Babel_Hybrid
===================

Combining B.A.T.M.A.N-ADV and Babel into a single routing protocol.

Routing is the most important concern in mobile ad-hoc networks as unlike static
networks the topology may change anytime during operation. Due to such dynamic
topology it is necessary to detect changes in topology and update the routes as soon
as possible to avoid node or network failures. Many different routing approaches are
suggested of which B.A.T.M.A.N-ADV and babel are popular and known to have
better performance than others.

The aim of the project is to introduce a new a experimental hybrid routing protocol
combining B.A.T.M.A.N-ADV and babel into a single routing protocol.
we compare the performance results of running unmodified babel instance
with performance results of modified instance of babel both running over
B.A.T.M.AN-ADV as a hybrid showing visible improvements in performance.

Considering wireless meshes no protocol is suitable for all types of meshes in
general.The hybrid implementation is an attempt to formulate a general solution for
all types of meshes.
